#Solarized Light-Dark Toggle

##Introduction
Solarized Light-Dark Toggle is a very simple plugin originally written to allow users of [Sublime Text 2][st2] and [Sublime Text 3][st3] to easily switch between light and dark versions of the Solarized color scheme.

Now any theme included with Sublime Text or installed separately can be used with a change to the plugin's settings file.

Why use this plugin? Instead of having to manually click Preferences->Color Scheme->Some Colors, you can simply press F12 in order to toggle between two themes. The default themes are Solarized Light and Solarized Dark.
